## Summary

Looking to freshen up my personal website, I was reading about what all the cool kids have started using since I last checked things out in 2020. Turns out AstroJS is the way to go.

Not only is it framework agnostic and only loads the minimum required JS, BUT there are some very nice clean looking templates available as well which saves me a bunch of time. I could even pick up my MD files from my old Hugo blog and drop them straight into my new one.

This also opened up the opportunity for me to host it directly on Github Pages instead of an Azure Static Web App, saving me precious beer money.

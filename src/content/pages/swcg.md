## Summary

A foray back into WYSIWYG site builders after 10 years or so. A lot has changed and the editors are quite comprehensive. I could spin up a (very modern looking) site in a matter of hours.

Compared Wix, Weebly and Strikingly for functionality, plugin support, ease of use and price. Selected Wix because they had a 50% promo at the time, my teammates had experience in using the Wix editor already and it had Instagram and EventBrite plugins which is really all we needed.
